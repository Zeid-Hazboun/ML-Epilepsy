# ML-Epilepsy

The following repository includes the codes used for preprocessing the EEGs for the collaboration project between the University of Groningen and the Technological institute of Monterry.
The code has seperate files for the main steps used, which are then combined in the **main**.py file.

The **psd.py** file is used to show the power distribution, in order to find the frequency of the powerline noise which was then removed in the **notch** function.

The code is written by Zeid Hazboun.
